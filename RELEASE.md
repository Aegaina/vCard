Hello there,
This is release 1.3 of VCF Reader. This release is special in that I moved the UI implementation from `WinForms` to a cross platform UI toolkit, `GTK#` to be precise. This is much in line with the new direction that Microsoft is taking in making tools and software more and more cross platform.

This release also makes use of the updated `vCardLib.dll`, version `2.1.0` to be precise. This brings `Mono` compatibility and stability fixes as well as feature additions. You can visit the library doc page [here](http://bolorundurowb.github.io/VCF-Reader/).

This software is now released under the MIT license, meaning it is truly free and open source. The repo is located at [https://github.com/bolorundurowb/VCF-Reader](https://github.com/bolorundurowb/VCF-Reader). Please raise any issues there and please don't forget to star my repo, it'll mean a lot to me.

Make sure you have `GTK Sharp 2.X` installed and `Mono` also if you're not on a windows PC. A quick google search will give you installation instructions.


Cheers.
